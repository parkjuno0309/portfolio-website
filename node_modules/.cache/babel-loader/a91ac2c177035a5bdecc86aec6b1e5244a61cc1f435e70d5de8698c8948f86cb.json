While the development of the project\n        was primarily collaborative, most of my responsibilities included\n        designing and implementing the backend server using a REST API.\n        Consequently, I also managed and intitialized the internal custom\n        database that was used for the application's functionality. While most\n        of my focus for this project was on the backend development, I was able\n        to exercise some of my frontend development skills to create temporary\n        UIs for testing connection to the backend.
