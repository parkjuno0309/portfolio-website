Within the intense 24-hour development\n        period, we engineered a meme generator that used web scraping and the\n        Python Imaging Library (PIL) to dynamically generate memes. Users could\n        enter a message, word, or phrase into a text box, and the application\n        would produce a meme incorporating the input in a contextually relevant\n        way, whether through image or text.\n        <br></br>\n        <br></br>\n        This project was not only a creative endeavor but also a significant\n        learning experience. It introduced me to the basics of web scraping and\n        Python scripting, foundational skills that I later applied in various\n        internships and projects. Our commitment to clean and efficient code\n        structure was recognized with the \"Best Code Structure\" award, a\n        testament to our team's skill and dedication in a competitive field of\n        about 70 teams. This experience was pivotal in enhancing my technical\n        abilities and understanding of user-centered application development.\n      </>,\n    ],\n    images: [],\n    demos: [],\n
